# Hardware-Software-SHA-3-HLS

Implementation of the paper "Hardware/Software Co-Design of A Dynamically Configurable SHA-3 System-on-Chip (SoC)"

Each of the two implementations contains an HLS code to build the accelerator using Vivado HLS, Zynq code to run on the Zynq processor, and scripts to build the Zynq/accelerator system on FPGA
